# automation

This repository contains support for building home automation systems. In
particular the autobot command line tool can be used to realize
scheduled operations in more flexible ways than typically supported
by the native system.

The entire system is extensible and currently there is support for
Lutron Homeworks and Pentair ScreenLogic systems, albeit in limited
form (lights and blinds only for Lutron, circuits only for ScreenLogic).
